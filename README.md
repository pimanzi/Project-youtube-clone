# Youtube Clone
## Description
Within this repo, there is a work of HTML and CSS, whereby I used it to create a clone of YouTube, yet it is not as interactive as the actual YouTube because it does not contain JavaScript.  
I created it during my first year at African Leadership University in 2023. Not only that but also this repo contains basic lessons about CSS and HTML.
